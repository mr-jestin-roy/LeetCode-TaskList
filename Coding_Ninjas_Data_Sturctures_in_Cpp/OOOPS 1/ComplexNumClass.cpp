Complex Number Class
A ComplexNumber class contains two data members : one is real part (R) and other is imaginary (I) (both integer).
Implement the Complex numbers class that contains following functions -
1. constructor
You need to create the appropriate constructor.
2. plus -
This function adds two given complex numbers and updates the first complex number.
e.g.
if C1 = 4 + i5 and C2 = 3 +i1
C1.plus(C2) results in: 
C1 = 7 + i6 and C2 = 3 + i1
3. multiply -
This function multiplies two given complex numbers and updates the first complex number.
e.g.
C1 = 4 + i5 and C2 = 1 + i2
C1.multiply(C2) results in: 
C1 = -6 + i13 and C2 = 1 + i2
4. print -
This function prints the given complex number in the following format :
a + ib
Note : There is space before and after '+' (plus sign) and no space between 'i' (iota symbol) and b.
Input Format :
Line 1 : Two integers - real and imaginary part of 1st complex number
Line 2 : Two integers - real and imaginary part of 2nd complex number
Line 3 : An integer representing choice (1 or 2) (1 represents plus function will be called and 2 represents multiply function will be called)
Sample Input 1 :
4 5
6 7
1
Sample Output 1 :
10 + i12
Sample Input 2 :
4 5
6 7
2
Sample Output 2 :
-11 + i58
